                    <p>In this blog post we are going to go through the minimum steps to set-up a hardened linux server. </p>

                    <h2>Configure the root user</h2>

                    <p>Once the server is installed, we can define a password for the root user, as follows:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo passwd
                    </pre>

                    <p>Then become root:</p>
                    <pre>
su -
                    </pre>

                    <p>Disable the root user's bash history:</p>
                    <pre>
echo "HISTFILESIZE=0" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
history -c
                    </pre>

                    <p>Configure timezone</p>
                    <pre>
timedatectl set-timezone Europe/London
                    </pre>

                    <p>Update packages</p>
                    <pre>
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
apt autoremove
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        If any package was installed as a result of the command "dist-upgrade", it is usually required
                        to reboot the server.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Create a custom user</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is not recommended to directly use the root user. We are going to create a custom user named
                        "alex" and assign to it the sudo permission (sudoer) so that it can escalates as root only when required.
                    </p>

                    <p>Create user "alex":</p>
                    <pre>
adduser alex
                    </pre>

                    <p>Add user as sudoer:</p>
                    <pre>
usermod -aG sudo alex
                    </pre>

                    <p>Check the user is a sudoer. The following should display “sudo” among the groups:</p>
                    <pre>
groups alex
                    </pre>

                    <p>Test sudo works:</p>
                    <pre>
su - alex
sudo apt-get update
                    </pre>

                    <p>If the above works, exit and login via SSH as "alex" to test this user can login via SSH:</p>
                    <pre>
exit
exit
exit
ssh alex@[server ip]
                    </pre>

                    <p>Disable the bash history for alex:</p>
                    <pre>
echo "HISTFILESIZE=0" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
history -c
                    </pre>

                    <h2>User created by the hosting provider</h2>
                    <p>
                        When a server is installed by a hosting company, they may create a custom user
                        allowing to login the first time. For example, the hosting company OVH creates a user based on the
                        installed linux distribution (e.g. user "ubuntu"). Now we have created our own custom user ("alex"),
                        we can remove the user created by the hosting company.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
sudo deluser [username created by hosting company] --remove-home
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Note: On Debian the option "--remove-home" does not work without perl. In that case, if we do not
                        want to install perl, please delete the user's home folder manually:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
sudo rm -fr /home/[username created by hosting company]
                    </pre>

                    <p>Check the home folder was deleted for [username created by hosting company]:</p>
                    <pre>
ls -al /home/
                    </pre>

                    <h2>Login to the server using a SSH key</h2>

                    <p>First, exit the server:</p>
                    <pre>
exit
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        If we do not have a SSH key, we are going to create it on the client computer (your laptop or desktop computer).
                        When creating it, it is highly recommended to set a passphrase for additional security.
                    </p>
                    <p>Create a SSH key on the client computer:</p>
                    <pre>
ssh-keygen -t rsa
                    </pre>
                    <p>The generated key should be in the folder “~/.ssh/”</p>

                    <p>Copy the created SSH public key from the client computer to the server:</p>
                    <pre>
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub alex@[server ip]
                    </pre>

                    <p>Login to the server to check it is working:</p>
                    <pre>
ssh alex@[server ip]
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        If it works, it should not ask for a password. If you have set a passphrase when creating the SSH
                        key then it will ask for it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Disable SSH login with password</h2>
                    <p>We assume that you are logged to the server as a custom user (e.g. "alex").</p>
                    <p>Open:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                    </pre>

                    <p>Set the following options’ values to “no”: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PasswordAuthentication: no</li>
                        <li>ChallengeResponseAuthentication: no</li>
                        <li>PermitRootLogin: no</li>
                        <li>UsePAM: no</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Add this line to only allow a custom user (e.g. "alex") to login via SSH:</p>
                    <pre>
AllowUsers alex
                    </pre>
                    <p>Save the file.</p>

                    <p>Check all values:</p>
                    <pre>
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PasswordAuthentication
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep ChallengeResponseAuthentication
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PermitRootLogin
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep UsePAM
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep AllowUsers
                    </pre>

                    <p>Restart SSHD daemon</p>
                    <pre>
sudo systemctl restart sshd
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        In case of there is an issue with the config changes, do not close the current terminal window.
                        Open a new terminal window and try connecting, as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
ssh alex@[server ip]
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        If it is working, we can close the old terminal window. If it does not work, then use the old
                        terminal window to check the contents of the file "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" in order to identify
                        where the error could be.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Enable auto-updates of packages</h2>
                    <p>
                        Auto-updates allow keeping a server's packages automatically up-to-date. Please follow the
                        instructions <a href="/blog/enable-auto-update-debian-distros.html">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Remove known insecure packages</h2>
                    <p>
                        Remove insecure services like Mail service, Telnet service, RSH service, NIS service, TFTP service
                        and TALK service:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
sudo apt-get --purge remove xinetd nis yp-tools tftpd atftpd tftpd-hpa telnetd rsh-server rsh-redone-server
                    </pre>

                    <h2>Check ports listened by internal services with "lsof"</h2>
                    <p>On Debian you may have to install lsof, as follows:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo apt-get install lsof
                    </pre>

                    <p>List the ports listened by internal services:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo lsof -i | grep LISTEN
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The output should only show the SSHD daemon listening to external traffic on port 22. If there are
                        other ports opened, and if they are unwanted, please remove the packages the services(s) depend on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, with the command "lsof" we noticed that on a Debian distro the SMTP service "Exim"
                        is installed and running by default and it is listening on port 25. If we want to remove this service,
                        we need to find the list of packages it is depending on:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
dpkg -l | grep exim
                    </pre>

                    <p>Output example:</p>
                    <pre>
exim4-base            4.94-15    amd64        support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
exim4-config          4.94-15    all          configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
exim4-daemon-light    4.94-15    amd64        lightweight Exim MTA (v4) daemon
                    </pre>

                    <p>Let's remove those packages:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo apt-get purge exim4-base exim4-config exim4-daemon-light
                    </pre>

                    <p>Once completed, we can also remove the obsolete packages which were installed with the removed
                        packages above:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo apt-get autoremove
                    </pre>

                    <h2>Done</h2>
                    <p>Once all sections above are completed, you have a minimum hardened set-up for a Linux server.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Additional actions to consider</h2>


                    <h3>Disabling Root Cron Jobs</h3>

                    <p>List cron jobs:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo ls /etc/cron*
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Then go to the listed file(s) to remove the app which is unwanted. For example, we can remove
                        "bsdmainutils":
                    </p>
                    <pre>
sudo apt-get purge bsdmainutils
                    </pre>

                    <h3>List services and stop the ones we do not want to use</h3>
                    <p>List services:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo service --status-all
OR
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled
                    </pre>

                    <p>Get info about a service:</p>
                    <pre>
sudo systemctl status sendmail
                    </pre>

                    <p>Disable a service</p>
                    <pre>
sudo systemctl disable sendmail
                    </pre>
