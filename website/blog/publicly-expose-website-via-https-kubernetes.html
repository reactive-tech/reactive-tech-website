                    <div class="publicationDetails"><time datetime="2021-03-18" pubdate="pubdate">18 March 2021</time> by Alex Arica</div>

                    <p>In this blog post we are going to publicly expose a website via HTTPS with Ingress Nginx controller
                        in a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. We are going to explain how to integrate Let’s Encrypt with
                        Kubernetes so that SSL certificates are issued and renewed automatically for our domain names.</p>

                    <p>We assume that you read the blog post about how to
                        <a href="publicly-expose-website-via-http-kubernetes.html">expose a website via HTTP using Ingress Nginx</a>.
                        This current page is a continuation of that blog post.</p>

                    <h2>Let's Encrypt</h2>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/">Let’s Encrypt</a> is a certificate
                        authority (CA) which provides HTTPS certificates for domain names without the need to manually
                        create an account with them. The process of requesting certificates and renewing them is fully
                        automated and free.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Install Cert-manager controller</h2>
                    <p>We are going to use <a target="_blank" href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/">Cert-manager</a>
                        which is a controller handling the creating and renewal of SSL certificates in Kubernetes.
                        It integrates well with the Ingress Nginx controller.
                    </p>

                    <p>Installation command:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/[version]/cert-manager.yaml
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Replace the variable "[version]" by the latest version available in the
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases">official Cert-manager's GitHub page</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once the installation command above is run, Cert-manager controller creates a namespace "cert-manager"
                        where it installs its custom resources. Let's wait until that all cert-manager pods are running:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager -w
                    </pre>

                    <h2>Create a certificate issuer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once Cert-manager is ready, we are going to create a "ClusterIssuer" using Let's Encrypt to issue SSL certificates.
                        The idea is to create this set-up once for the entire cluster. And we will be able to reference that resource
                        from any namespace for websites which meed a certificate for their domain names. That's the reason
                        why "ClusterIssuer" resource is used rather than an "Issuer" resource.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A "ClusterIssuer" allows to register to a certificate authority like Let's Encrypt. Then Let's Encrypt can issue certificates.
                        Each time a resource like an Ingress Nginx controller wants to create a SSL certificate for a domain name,
                        it will delegate this operation to a "ClusterIssuer" to request the SSL certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are going to create a staging issuer so that we can test the process is working. I highly recommend
                        creating a staging issuer before using a prod one, because it will allow to test our installation.
                    </p>

                    <p>Add:</p>

                    <p>
                        In the yaml above, we configured the private key to be in the secret "lets-encrypt-staging".
                        Cert-Manager will create it with the key provided by Let's Encrypt. Please replace
                        "email: contact@reactive.tech.io" by your email address. Let's encrypt will us that email to notify
                        about certificate expiry dates, etc...
                    </p>

                    <p>Deploy it:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl apply -f lets-encrypt-staging-issuer.yaml
                    </pre>

                    <p>Check the issuer is ready:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl get ClusterIssuer -n cert-manager -w
                    </pre>

                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre>
NAME                   READY   AGE
lets-encrypt-staging   True    5s
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        In the yaml above, we configured the private key to be in the secret "lets-encrypt-staging".
                        Let's check that Cert-Manager created it:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
kubectl get secret lets-encrypt-staging -n cert-manager
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Once our ClusterIssuer is ready, we can configure our existing Ingress configuration
                        so that the domain name "www.reactive-tech.io" has an SSL certificate.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Issue a staging certificate for "www.reactive-tech.io"</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are going to create a staging SSL certificate for the domain "www.reactive-tech.io" by referencing
                        the "ClusterIssuer" that we have created.
                    </p>
                    <p>Modify the existing ingress resource that we have created in the
                        <a target="_blank" href="publicly-expose-website-via-http-kubernetes.html">previous blog post</a>, by updating the file:</p>
                    <pre>
vi reactive-tech-website-ingress.yaml
                    </pre>
                    <p>And add the configuration marked in bold:</p>
                    <pre>
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress

        paths:

            path: "/"
            backend:

                  number: 80

                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        The new lines marked in bold above, are instructing Ingress controller to delegate the process of
                        issuing a SSL certificate to a resource of type "ClusterIssuer" with name "lets-encrypt-staging".
                        And the line "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: false" instructs to NOT force a redirection from HTTP
                        to HTTPS. Otherwise, all requests for the domain www.reactive-tech-io will go through HTTPS (port 443) even
                        if the initial call was via HTTP (port 80). We will enable this option later when we will issue a production SSL certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The configuration "secretName: reactive-tech-website-cert-staging" instruct Cert-Manager to create
                        a secret and store the SSL certificate keys in it. The secret's namespace would be the same as the Ingress
                        configuration. In this case the namespace used is "static-websites".
                    </p>

                    <p>Apply the new configurations:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl apply -f reactive-tech-website-ingress.yaml
                    </pre>

                    <p>Let's check the secret "reactive-tech-website-cert-staging" was created by Cert-manager:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl get secret reactive-tech-website-cert-staging -n static-websites
                    </pre>

                    <p>Next, we are going to check that the staging certificate was successfully issued by Let's Encrypt:</p>
                    <pre>
kubectl get clusterissuer,certificate,certificaterequest,order,challenge -n static-websites
                    </pre>
                    <p>All listed resources should have their column "READY" set to "true". For example:</p>
                    <pre>
NAME                                                 READY   AGE

NAME                                                                          READY   AGE
certificaterequest.cert-manager.io/reactive-tech-website-cert-staging-f7h2r   True    46s

NAME                                                                            STATE   AGE

                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Once the resources above all are ready, it means that Let's Encrypt assigned a staging SSL certificate
                        for the domain "www.reactive-tech.io". The way it works is the Cert-Manager controller creates
                        an endpoint using Ingress, such as: "www.reactive-tech.io/.well-known/acme-challenge/[token]".
                        <br/> The [token] variable is a long string such as "w5tYb92Vt0GAHm1i5a2FXSk2VHYbmHOFTzTItV2U5T".
                        Then Let's Encrypt calls that endpoint to validate the domain name and then assigns an SSL certificate.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the resources above are NOT ready, that means Let's Encrypt could not issue an SSL certificate.
                        And this could happen if you are using an external load balancer to route the traffics to Ingress
                        Nginx controller. Please make sure to configure your load balancer using TCP option rather than HTTP
                        and HTTPS when defining the routing rules. Otherwise, if HTTP and HTTPS options are used, the load balancer is likely to
                        rewrite the routing rules preventing Let's Encrypt to validate your domain name using the endpoint
                        "www.reactive-tech.io/.well-known/acme-challenge/[token]".
                    </p>
                    <p>Cert-Manager's doc has a page about <a target="_blank" href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/faq/acme/">troubleshooting</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Call the website via HTTPS using the staging cert</h2>
                    <p>
                        The last step is to call the website "www.reactive-tech.io" via HTTPS. The browser should warn you
                        that the SSL certificate is not signed by a certificate authority. This is normal since it is a
                        staging certificate. Accept the risk and you should be able to access to the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step is to create a valid production SSL certificate which will be accepted as valid by the browsers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Issue a production certificate for "www.reactive-tech.io"</h2>
                    <p>First, we need to crete a production ClusterIssuer using Let's Encrypt. In a new file:</p>
                    <pre>
vi lets-encrypt-prod-issuer.yaml
                    </pre>

                    <p>Add the configurations below. We marked in bold the differences with the staging ClusterIssuer:</p>

                    <pre>
kubectl get ClusterIssuer -n cert-manager -w

                    <p>
                        The last step is to call the website "www.reactive-tech.io" via HTTPS. The browser should accept
                        the SSL certificate without any warning since it was signed by the certificate authority Let's Encrypt.
                        We should be able to access to the website via HTTPS.
