                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kubegres.io/">Kubegres</a></b> is a Kubernetes operator
                        allowing to deploy one or many clusters of PostgreSql pods with data replication and failover enabled
                        out-of-the box. It brings simplicity when using PostgreSql considering how
                        complex managing stateful-set's life-cycle and data replication could be with Kubernetes.</p>
                    <p>Kubegres has the following features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It can manage one or many clusters of Postgres instances. Each cluster of Postgres instances
                            is created using a YAML of "kind: Kubegres". Each cluster is self-contained and is identified
                            by its unique name and namespace.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It creates a cluster of PostgreSql servers with data replication enabled: it creates a
                            Primary PostgreSql pod and a number of Replica PostgreSql pods and replicates primary's
                            database in real-time to Replica pods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It manages fail-over: if a Primary PostgreSql crashes, it automatically promotes a Replica
                            PostgreSql as a Primary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has a data backup option allowing to dump PostgreSql data regularly in a given volume.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It provides a very simple YAML with properties specialised for PostgreSql.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is resilient, has over
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reactive-tech/kubegres/tree/main/test">55
                                automatized tests cases</a>
                            and has been running in production.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It works with the <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">
                            PostgreSql containers</a> created by the
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">
                                Docker Official Images team</a>. Kubegres uses the standard PostgreSql libraries to
                            manage replication and failover and it does not require a custom Docker image with
                            a set of third party libraries.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is portable because compatible with any Docker images which derive from the

                                PostgreSql containers</a>.

                    </ul>
