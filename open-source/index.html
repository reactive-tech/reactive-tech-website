                    The majority of the software that we are using are open source. They are developed by passionate people.
                    Since we are all benefiting from this fantastic contribution, Reactive Tech Limited believes in the
                    importance of giving back to the communities by contributing to open source.

                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kubegres.io/">Kubegres</a> is a Kubernetes operator allowing to
                    deploy a cluster of PostgreSql pods with data replication enabled out-of-the box. It brings simplicity
                    when using PostgreSql considering how complex managing stateful-set's life-cycle and data replication
                    could be with Kubernetes.

                    developers to write websites in core HTML, JS and CSS. When using Gigo there is no need to learn a
                    custom templating language. Just work with the standards core HTML, JS and CSS and write portable websites.
